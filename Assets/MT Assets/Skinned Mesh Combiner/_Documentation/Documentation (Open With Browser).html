                    The Skinned Mesh Combiner is a tool that will help you merge the meshes that use the Skinned Mesh Renderer. The Skinned Mesh Combiner only works with this type of mesh. The Skinned Mesh Combiner has some merging methods,
                    each method has its pros and cons, you can see this below in the documentation. See the video demo below and follow the reduction of draw calls with each type of merge.

                    <doc.topictitle>First Steps To Combine</doc.topictitle>

                    Before you begin to merge your meshes, you must first prepare the entire GameObjects hierarchy and properly validate Skinned Mesh Renderers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 1 -</b> Your hierarchy of Skinned Meshes should be as shown in the image below. For example, if you want to combine a character, your meshes must be organized the way you explain the image below...
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/1">
                        The order in which "Armature (Bones)" is, does not matter. He just needs to be a child of "Character".
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "Character" GameObject must have the Animator that will be responsible for executing the animations of its Skinned Meshes. The Skinned Mesh Combiner component should be in the Root GameObject (Character), because
                        when you start the merge, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will search for all the Skinned Mesh affiliated with it. Each GameObject "SkinnedMeshX" in image, contains a Skinned Mesh Renderer.
                    </doc.image>

                    <b>Step 2 -</b> Make sure all of your meshes have materials associated with them. Meshes that have empty materials will be ignored during the merge.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/2">
                        Avoid leaving null materials on Skinned Mesh Renderers. This also helps with optimization.
                    </doc.image>

                    <b>Step 3 -</b> Prevent your Skinned Mesh Renderers from having null meshes, as any Skinned Mesh Renderer that has null meshes will be ignored during the merge process.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/3"></doc.image>

                    <b>Step 4 -</b> Make sure that all the materials that your meshes use have Main Textures. This is not an obligation, and depends on the merging mode, but it may be good to have textures associated with all materials.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 5 -</b> Now that everything is ready, it's just you to Combine the Meshes! For this, keep reading.

                    <doc.topictitle>How to Combine Meshes</doc.topictitle>

                    To Combine your Meshes in Editor, it's very simple and easy! Let's go step by step. With this method, you will not need to use any line of code, and in addition, when the scene starts your meshes will already be
                    combined!

                    <doc.info>
                        You can also combine your meshes at Runtime!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For this you need to use the C# API of the Skinned Mesh Combiner component. Continue reading or <a href="#6">click here</a> to go directly to the Skinned Mesh Combiner C# API.
                    </doc.info>

                    <b>Step 1 -</b> Add the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component to the root GameObject of your Skinned Meshes.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/4">
                        Select the root GameObject for your model. Then click "Add Component." Search for "Skinned Mesh Combiner". Then just add the component that appears in the image above.
                    </doc.image>
                    <doc.warn>
                        For Legacy Animation System Users: If you use the legacy animation system to animate your character, you must have an "Animation" component in your character's root GameObject (in place of the Animator). If
                        so, right after adding the Skinned Mesh Combiner, you will see an error message, just activate the Legacy Animation support.
                    </doc.warn>

                    <b>Step 2 -</b> Select the <doc.detach>Combine Method</doc.detach>. Each merge method has advantages and disadvantages, and each one merge the meshes in a different way. We'll talk about the merge methods below in this
                    documentation.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/5">
                        Just click on the <doc.detach>Combine Method</doc.detach> box and choose one of the options.

                        (Some merge methods will provide you with a variable called <doc.detach>Material To Use</doc.detach>. You must provide a material to be used by the mesh resulting from the merge. Skinned Mesh Combiner will apply the
                        material you supply, that is, a copy of the material you supply, and will apply it to the combined mesh)

                    <b>Step 4 -</b> Wait a few moments and when the "Combine Meshes!" switching to "Undo Merge" means that the meshes were combined! After combining, new mesh (Result of Merge) will be generated and old meshes will be
                    deactivated. You can always undo the merge whenever you want!

                    <br>
                    Automatically, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will also show you the "Logs Of Merge" tab that contains all messages generated by the Skinned Mesh Combiner while the merge was being performed. This is how the Skinned Mesh
                    Combiner communicates with you, in case you find something wrong, or think it's important to let you know!
                    <doc.warn>
                        If you want to undo the merge, it is NOT recommended that you delete the mesh resulting from the merge manually. Always use the "Undo Merge" button for this!

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Combiner: Explaining the Interface</doc.topictitle>

                    In this topic, the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component interface will be explained to reveal details about each part and its uses.

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>The "Merge" Tab</doc.topicsubtitle>

                    In the "Merge" tab we have all the parameters and utilities that we need to combine the meshes. We will talk about the other tabs below.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In "Settings For Combiner" we have all the options and preferences that we can change, before making the merge.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/7"></doc.image>

                    In "Ignore During Merge" we can register GameObjects to be ignored during the merge. In this way, we can exclude certain parts of our character for example, and those parts will not be included in the mesh resulting from
                    the merge.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/8"></doc.image>

                    In "Merge Events" we can register methods to be called whenever the Skinned Mesh Combiner component performs a merge, or undoes a merge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In "Debugging And Resources" we can adjust the debugging parameters of the merge process and we can also see all the resources (such as Materials, Meshes and Textures) that were found by the Skinned Mesh Combiner, before
                    performing the merge. In this way, we will know what the SMC will use to combine the meshes.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/9"></doc.image>

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>The "Stats" Tab</doc.topicsubtitle>
                    In the "Stats" tab you have access to information about a merge that was made, as well as access to the resources generated by the merge as well. The contents of this tab are only available, if there is a currently
                    active merge in the "Skinned Mesh Combiner" component.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/10"></doc.image>

                    <doc.topicsubtitle>The "Logs Of Merge" Tab</doc.topicsubtitle>
                    In the "Logs of Merge" tab you have access to all the Logs or Warnings that were generated while the meshes were being combined. This is where you will know everything the Skinned Mesh Combiner has done and which
                    deserves your attention.

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Combiner: About the Merge Method "One Mesh Per Material"</doc.topictitle>

                    Briefly speaking, the "One Mesh Per Material" method combines all meshes that share the same material into one. So if you have 5 meshes that use material A, those 5 meshes will be combined in 1 mesh, which will use this
                    material A. I will explain more precisely below.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First the Skinned Mesh Combiner looks for the Skinned Meshes that are the childrens of the GameObject in which it is. Then, the Skinned Mesh Combiner groups meshes that use the same material. When you have a mesh that
                    uses more than 1 material, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will separate the faces of this mesh according to each material.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/12">
                        Each box represents a GameObject containing the Skinned Mesh Renderer.
                        <br>
                        Green boxes use material A, blue boxes use material B and brown boxes use material C.
                    </doc.image>

                    After separating each mesh, it creates a new GameObject. This new GameObject will group the new meshes resulting from the merge.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/13"></doc.image>

                    Then after that, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will combine all the meshes and submeshes that share the same material, and insert all into a one mesh inside the GameObject created in past step.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/14"></doc.image>

                    And finally, the Skinned Mesh Combiner simply disables the old meshes.

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Combiner: About the Merge Method "All In One"</doc.topictitle>

                    Briefly speaking, the "All In One" method will merge all meshes into one, and only one new mesh will be generated that will be the junction of all the others. Then it will merge all the textures into one atlas, and will
                    insert that atlas into a new material. At the end, this material will be inserted into the unique mesh.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this merge method, all the textures to be merged must have the "Read/Write enabled" option in the import settings. If you have 5 meshes, only 1 mesh, 1 material and 1 atlas will remain after the merge. This method
                    is a bit more complex, so try to understand well how it works before using it.
                    <doc.warn>
                        Some rare meshes can offer problems for this method, according to the way in which they were created. For example, some meshes may contain errors in your UV map, which can generate errors during the merge, however,
                        the vast majority of the tested meshes did not result in errors during the merge and everything worked perfectly in tests!
                    </doc.warn>
                    First, it merges all the meshes together, creating a new mesh that is the junction of all. However, this new mesh does not have any material.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/16"></doc.image>

                    After you provide a custom material (Material To Use), the Skinned Mesh Combiner will copy your material when creating the new material. This new created material will be inserted into the created mesh.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/17"></doc.image>

                    After this, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will extract the texture of each old mesh and will create an atlas texture. It will create atlas textures according to your preferences, being able to create atlas with textures,
                    normal maps, occlusion maps and etc.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/18"></doc.image>

                    Then the created mesh will have its UVs modified so that it can receive the new atlas. Then the atlas is inserted into the new mesh created.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/19"></doc.image>

                    Finally, old meshes are disabled. Resting only the mesh created with its material and texture with atlas.

                    The "Just Material Colors" merge method only merges the colors of the materials in your meshes. To do this, it collects the color of each material that its meshes use, creates an atlas that contains a palette of colors
                    for each mesh that was merged, then color that mesh with its respective color. It is a very simple merge method and made for people who need to merge their models that do not use textures, just material colors!

                    First, it merges all the meshes together, creating a new mesh that is the junction of all. However, this new mesh does not have any material.

                    Then a new material is created from the material you provide (Material To Use). This new created material will be inserted into the created mesh.

                    This merge method is unique to the Skinned Meshes generated by the Unity Technologies Anima2D tool, and only works when the tool is also installed in your project. The merge process is similar to "All In One", but only

                    After this, the Skinned Mesh Combiner adds a Combined Mesh Manager script to render atlas in merged mesh. This script is responsible for collecting the sprites, creating a new material, and applying the rendering data to

                        Anima2D is a tool developed and maintained by Unity Technologies, and like any other tool, it is also subject to bugs and flaws. Sometimes, after combining the meshes, you may notice some bugs in the meshes, but in
                        the vast majority of cases the problem is caused by a flaw in the Anima2D scripts. Usually, recreating your character's bone structure or merging again can solve this problem. Usually the most common bugs are related
                        to the rendering order of the Sprite Meshes after combined. You can always use the tool mentioned in the topic below. If you need help, just contact mtassets@windsoft.xyz!

                    Sometimes, by combining the sprites of your characters with "Only Anima2D" merge method, you may notice that some sprites are over other sprites, an unwanted effect. For example, an arm may lie on top of the body of the

                    <br>

                        In the example, the body remained on the left arm and the neck remained on the face. That was not the expected result.

                    To correct this, we must change the GameObjects order of each part of the character in the hierarchy and this must be done before the merge begins. So we can organize which sprites will be on top of others. Knowing this
                    need, the Skinned Mesh Combiner has a tool that provides you with an intuitive and easy to understand interface, so you can organize the rendering order of your character's meshes, all quickly and in a functional way!
                    After organizing your character's meshes with this tool, the same rederization order you defined will be used, both after merging, as well as before doing it!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the Skinned Mesh Combiner component, you need to be using the "Only Anima2D Meshes" merge method. So if the Skinned Mesh Combiner detects meshes to be combined, it will show you the
                    <doc.detach>Set Correct Sprite Meshes Rendering Order</doc.detach> button. Click this button and the mesh rendering order organization interface will appear, so just use the <doc.detach>/\</doc.detach> and
                    <doc.detach>\/</doc.detach> buttons to organize the mesh order. The higher a mesh is at the top, the higher it will be rendered over the others.

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Combiner: Using additional effects like Normal Maps, Height Maps, and more</doc.topictitle>

                    It is very simple to process and combine the maps of your models too, using the Skinned Mesh Combiner! See below how to include the maps of your models (Normal Map, Height Maps and etc.) in your merges too!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>One Mesh Per Material:</b> The "One Mesh Per Material" method can merge your meshes with special effects automatically without any problem, plus you will not have to configure anything other than your own shaders.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Just Material Colors:</b> The "Just Material Colors" method is designed to support only material colors, so it does not support texture merging or special effects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Only Anima2D Meshes:</b> This merging method was designed to support only meshes generated by Anima2D, that is, "2D meshes". These meshes have no effects, so this merging method does not support these effects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>All In One:</b> "All In One" supports special effects of your materials! You just need to enable support and configure it. After that, just merge! See below how to do the procedure.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Step 1 -</b> First, activate support for the effect you want. When you activate support for an effect, the Skinned Mesh Combiner, in addition to creating an atlas for your model's textures, it will also create an
                    atlas with the textures of the effect you want. This atlas will be based on the texture atlas of your model.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/29"></doc.image>

                    <b>Step 2 -</b> Select the property of your model materials, which store the Texture/Map of the desired effect! This is how the Skinned Mesh Combiner will know where to look for the textures of the effect that you also
                    want to apply, to combine them!
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/30"></doc.image>

                    <b>Step 3 -</b> Select the material property you provided <doc.detach>Material To Use</doc.detach> to store the atlas of the desired effect. In this case, the <doc.detach>_BumpMap</doc.detach> property of the material I
                    supplied (my material is a Standard) will be responsible for storing the Normal Map atlas that the Skinned Mesh Combiner generates.
                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/31"></doc.image>

                    <b>Property Name To Find:</b> It is nothing more than the name of the variable that stores the textures of the desired effect in its materials. For example, if you have enabled Normal Maps support, the Skinned Mesh
                    Combiner will look for the variable <doc.detach>_BumpMap</doc.detach> in each shader of each material in your mesh, when the Skinned Mesh Combiner finds this variable it will extract the texture of Normal Map of the
                    variable. When it has all the normal map textures, it will merge them into an atlas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Property Name To Insert:</b> It is the variable that will store the atlas texture of normal maps, in the final material. For example, at the end of the merge, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will look for the variable
                    <doc.detach>_BumpMap</doc.detach> in the final material and will insert the normal maps atlas in this variable.

                    URP, LWRP and HDRP (rendering pipelines) have new default property names in the shaders. For example, in the Built-In pipeline (Unity default) the default name of the property that stores your character's textures is
                    <doc.detach>_MainTex</doc.detach>, however, in HDRP and URP this default name has been changed to <doc.detach>_BaseMap</doc.detach>. Therefore, if you use HDRP, URP shaders or different shaders (created by third parties
                    for example), you can change the properties where the SMC seeks the textures. To do this, deselect the option <doc.detach>Default Main Tex. Prop.</doc.detach>, Doing so the Skinned Mesh Combiner will allow you to change
                    the default properties where the textures will be searched and applied.

                    The Skinned Mesh Combiner has some limitations. See below for what they are and their explanations.

                    <br>
                    <b>Rare incompatibilities with some meshes -</b> The Skinned Mesh Combiner has always been shown to work very well with all meshes in test and production environments, however, some rare meshes, depending on how they
                    were created, may have problems with merging methods that combine all meshes into one, such as "All In One" and "Just Material Colors" (One Mesh Per Material does not have this limitation). These rare incompatibility
                    problems can occur due to UV mapping problems in the mesh, for example, which cause the Skinned Mesh Combiner to fail to do the mapping correctly and etc.

                    When we are working on developing a game that has characters, it is common for that character to have a bone hierarchy. This hierarchy of bones is visible in Unity, and whenever we move a GameObject (bone) in the scene,
                    the character's mesh is also deformed, and so the animation occurs. When we need to attach things to the character's hand, like a sword for example, we simply put the sword as a GameObject child of the GameObject bone of
                    the character's hand and that's it, whenever the character moves his hand, the sword will follow, because it is in the bone of the character's hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is good and works well, however, we often use static meshes (Mesh Filter + Mesh Renderer) to do this, and these static meshes cannot be combined with the other meshes of the person, as they are not animated meshes.
                    So, in situations where the character has a lot of static meshes stuck in their bones, the performance improvement may not be great, even combining all of the character's Skinned meshes
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thinking about this need for optimization, the Skinned Mesh Converter component was developed and is supplied together with the Skinned Mesh Combiner package! The sole purpose of this component is to convert static
                    meshes that are attached to the character's bones, into Skinned meshes, so that, after conversion, it is possible to combine all the character's meshes, together with the static meshes, converted to Skinned!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To recap, if you have a sword (static mesh, Mesh Filter + Mesh Renderer) just use the "Skinned Mesh Converter" component to convert it to Skinned Mesh and then combine all your character's meshes, next to the sword! Keep
                    reading to better understand how the conversion is done!

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Converter: How to convert a Static Mesh (Mesh Filter + Mesh Renderer) to a Skinned Mesh </doc.topictitle>

                    We have the following situation. We have a character who has his body and clothes with Skinned meshes, which is quite common. However, the mesh of his glasses, beard and earring are static meshes (Mesh Filter + Mesh
                    Renderer) and so, even if we combine the character's body and clothing meshes, these static meshes will remain unmerged, preventing further optimization.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/34"></doc.image>

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/35"></doc.image>

                    Please note that all static meshes above are within the character's head bone, so if we move the character's head, all meshes will be moved together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The conversion is done in a very simple way. We just need to click on the static mesh we want to convert and then add the "Skinned Mesh Converter" component to it.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/36"></doc.image>

                    The static mesh of the beard is attached to the "Head" bone. So if we move the GameObject (bone) "Head", the beard will also be moved. Now that we've added the "Skinned Mesh Converter" component to the beard mesh, the
                    first thing we need to do is define the bone (or GameObject) that will make the mesh move. Therefore, as we know that the "Head" bone must move the mesh to be converted, we leave the GameObject Transform "Head" in the
                    <doc.detach>Bone That Will Move Mesh</doc.detach> parameter and then click on "Convert Mesh To Skinned!"

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/37"></doc.image>

                    After clicking on the button, the "Skinned Mesh Converter" will convert the static mesh and create a new GameObject child of the static mesh, that child GameObject contains the Skinned Mesh result of the conversion. The
                    original static mesh is automatically disabled.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/38"></doc.image>

                    And that is the result of the conversion! The beard mesh quickly became a Skinned Mesh, now we can combine the beard with the other body meshes and the character's clothes! From now on, the converted beard mesh will only
                    be moved when the GameObject "Head" moves, it will follow the movement of the GameObject "Head", so everything will continue to work perfectly well, the animation will continue to work normally and etc. Now we just need
                    to do this with the other static meshes!

                    <doc.topictitle>Skinned Mesh Bones Manager: Making a Mesh Use The Bone Hierarchy of Another Mesh, To Be Animated</doc.topictitle>

                    You may have already come across a character customization system. Typically, many games use multiple FBX files, a different file for each mesh. In the following example character, the head is the main mesh, has its
                    hierarchy of bones and the clothes must be attached to it to form the body.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/42">
                        It seems that the character has all the meshes together, but it doesn't. Each character's outfit is a different mesh, a different FBX file.
                    </doc.image>

                    However, note that when I move the bones of the head bone hierarchy, the rest of the body does not move, even if I move bones in the spine, arm, etc. This is because each mesh (clothing) of the character, still has its
                    own hierarchy of bones, and if I want to make the animations of the shirt for example, I need to move the bones of the shirt, not move the bones of the head. We are going to use the Skinned Mesh Bones Manager to make all
                    the clothes come alive using the head bone hierarchy, so when we move any bone from the head bone hierarchy, the clothes will also be deformed. Keep reading to learn more!

                    <doc.video src="DocumentationFiles/videos/2" thumbnail="DocumentationFiles/thumbs/2"></doc.video>

                    First, in order for it to be possible for a mesh to be animated using the bone hierarchy of another mesh, both must have a hierarchy of identical bones. See the example below, where I show the hierarchy of bones of the
                    head, and the shirt.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/43">
                        The two meshes have an IDENTICAL bone hierarchy, with the same names, bones in the same indices, etc. To make this possible, when creating my model, I did the following: I created your body, created and placed the
                        bone hierarchy and assigns the weights making the bone hierarchy animate my character's body. So, I created 5 copies of my character's body. In the first copy, I deleted all the vertices of my character's body,
                        leaving only the head. In the second copy I deleted all the vertices of my character, leaving only the vertices pertaining to the shirt, and so on for the remaining 3 copies. In the end, the head, shirt, pants, hair
                        and shoes were left. All using the same bone hierarchy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All bones in the bone hierarchy must remain there, in all meshes, even if not all bones are used. For example, in the head, the leg bones, arms, etc. still remain in the hierarchy, but they do not move anything, only
                        the bones of the neck and head make the movement of the head. In the T-shirt, the bones of the legs, head and etc. are still there, but only the bones of the spine, arms and etc. can animate the head.
                    </doc.image>

                    Just to make things clearer for you, in case you still have doubts: Going to Blender, see the head mesh and the shirt mesh, and their respective bone hierarchy.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/44">
                        This is the mesh of the head and its hierarchy of bones, in Blender.
                    </doc.image>

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/45">
                        This is the mesh of the Shirt and its hierarchy of bones, in Blender. Note that the two are identical.
                    </doc.image>

                    Now, at Unity, we are going to make the "Shirt" mesh use the same bone hierarchy as the "Head" mesh, using the Skinned Mesh Bones Manager component. See below. Realize that right after the "Shirt" mesh starts using the
                    "Head" mesh hierarchy, the "Shirt" already begins to be animated by the bones of the "Head" bone hierarchy.

                    <doc.video src="DocumentationFiles/videos/3" thumbnail="DocumentationFiles/thumbs/3">
                        To do this, I went to the "Skinned Mesh Bones Manager" present in the "Shirt" mesh and then dragged the Skinned Mesh Renderer from the "Head" mesh to the <doc.detach>Bones Hierarchy To Use</doc.detach> field. And
                        then, I just clicked "Use Bones Hierarchy From That Skinned Mesh Renderer".
                    </doc.video>

                    Now let's repeat the process for all of our character's meshes, so all meshes will be animated by the bone hierarchy of our character's head.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is important to note that: The Skinned Mesh Bones Manager will only allow the use of another bone hierarchy, if the other bone hierarchy is identical to the bone hierarchy of the current mesh.

                    <doc.video src="DocumentationFiles/videos/4" thumbnail="DocumentationFiles/thumbs/4">
                        Now our entire character is animated by the hierarchy of bones in the head.

                    <doc.topictitle>Incredible Tips That Can Be Useful: Avoid differences in positioning of Normal Maps and other Maps in the mesh resulting from the merge</doc.topictitle>

                    If you have Textures and Normal Maps (or other types of maps like Occlusion) and are trying to combine using the "All In One" method and your Textures have different and varied resolutions, you can end up with situations
                    where Normal Map for example, looks like be positioned incorrectly. As in the example below.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/46">
                        Note that after performing the merge, the normal map seemed more "expanded".
                    </doc.image>

                    This happened because the Textures have a lower resolution than the Normal Map textures. The textures are 256x256 while the normal maps are 512x512. So Normal maps end up being positioned only in the center of the
                    texture and there are still some parts of Normal Maps left.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/47">
                        Due to the fact that Normal Map is larger than the texture itself, it ends up being poorly positioned over the texture
                    </doc.image>

                    The Skinned Mesh Combiner, upon identifying that this may occur, will display this warning to you.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/48"></doc.image>

                    To correct this problem simply click on the "Fix all textures where the resolution is different" button. Or if you prefer, do it manually, for that... Leave ALL the Textures and Maps of your model, in uniform
                    resolutions. In my example model, I fixed this problem by simply resizing all Textures, Normal Maps, Occlusion Maps and etc. to the uniform size of 512x512. So in the atlas, all textures will be the same size and the
                    positioning will be perfect!

                    The edges in each texture of an atlas avoid distortions by mip maps, when the camera moves away from the 3D model, or remains at certain angles. The larger the border of each texture, the less chance of artifacts
                    appearing. With SMC you have complete freedom to select the size of the borders you want to use in the textures of your atlases, and if you are noticing artifacts in your models, just increase the size of the borders.
                    However, it is important that you never use borders larger than the textures themselves, because, in addition to increasing the time it takes to create the borders, you will also cause the texture to lose A LOT of
                    quality. See below...

                    To create a prefab automatically after the merge, enable the "Save Prefab Of Merge" option in the Skinned Mesh Combiner component.

                    <b>Avoid combining meshes multiple times in a short time -</b> Doing this kind of thing can consume too much memory from the heap, and cause performance losses in your game. If your game has a customization system for
                    example, just combine the meshes when the player finishes customizing.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Enable garbage collectors by undoing a merge via the C# API -</b> Enabling this setting will cause the Skinned Mesh Combiner to clear the memory used by the data that was deleted when you undo the merge. This prevents
                    your heap memory from filling up quickly. Use this option with caution as this can cause in-game freezes depending on how much data to exclude.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Combining several characters right at the beginning of the scene -</b> If you need to combine multiple characters (for example, NPCs) early in the game, it may be a bad idea to do this at runtime, since too much
                    memory can
                    be consumed or cause freezes in the game. In these cases, give preference to merge through the Editor (Inspector) so that as soon as the scene is executed the characters will already be merged. If you prefer, you can
                    enable the "Save Data In Assets" option. When you enable this option, whenever you merge meshes using the Inspector, data from those meshes will be saved to the files in your project. This makes it even easier to create
                    pre-merged prefabs!

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>One Mesh Per Material or Just Material Colors to combine at runtime -</b> The "One Mesh Per Material" and "Just Material Colors" merge method is faster and generates much less garbage besides being almost
                    instantaneous, so it's a great merge method to use while your game runs. Even so, avoid merging many models at the same time, or many so-called merge in a short period of time.

                    This error occurs when the Anima2D asset scripts and namespace are removed from the project. The Skinned Mesh Combiner can no longer detect the scripts, which causes compilation errors. The Skinned Mesh Combiner has a

                    It is not always possible for textures to completely fill the atlas, even if they are perfect squares. Textures must have edges (as if they were tiled) in order to be able to support mipmaps with atlas. These borders
                    increase the size of the textures and often make them no longer perfect squares. Another factor is the varying size of the textures or even the spacing between each texture in the atlas (which can be configured in the
                    Skinned Mesh Combiner). But these are some of the factors that make it not always possible for textures to completely fill the atlas. See an example below.

                    <doc.topictitle>Problems Solution: Why do the Tiled Textures look stretched or look strange after merge?</doc.topictitle>

                    See below for a good example of a tiled texture that looks stretched or strange after merging.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/55"></doc.image>

                    We first need to understand why this happens, and for that, we need to know how the options for Merge Tiled textures work. Note that this only happens in "All In One" merge mode. Let's talk about the
                    <doc.detach>Merge Tiled Textures</doc.detach> option.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Skip All -</b> The Skinned Mesh Combiner will simply skip any meshes that have tiled textures and exclude them from the merge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Legacy Mode -</b> The Skinned Mesh Combiner will map the UV of tiled textures as if they were any other normal textures, this gives the impression that the texture is stretched on the mesh, as it is no longer tiled
                    and in fact stretched to fit across the entire UV of the mesh.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Improved Mode -</b> The Skinned Mesh Combiner uses a new algorithm that is capable of supporting tiled textures, even if the UV coordinates of the mesh vertices are negative. The thing here, however, is that the
                    Skinned Mesh Combiner will tile these textures within the final atlas. If a mesh has a very large tile, the texture will be repeated more and more times within the atlas, which will end up generating a low quality when
                    the texture is rendered on the mesh.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Look at the image above. Note that in the first part the original shape of the texture is displayed. In the second part the texture seemed stretched because the tiled textures blend mode used was "Legacy Mode". In the
                    third part, the texture seemed strange because the blend mode used was "Improved Mode" and the mesh of the skirt has a huge tile. See below, in the blender, the UV mapping of the character's skirt mesh.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/56">
                        Note that the skirt's UV mapping is much larger than the texture actually is, which generates a large tiling. So, with "Improved Mode" the texture has lost a lot of definition. It was repeated over and over again to
                        the point that there was not so much room to keep repeating while maintaining the definition of the texture.
                    </doc.image>

                    Now let's make a comparison, with a tiled mesh, but without a huge UV map, so that it is not repeated over and over again in the final atlas.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/57"></doc.image>

                    Note that this time we use the shirt's mesh as an example. The shirt's mesh uses a tiled texture, but the tiling is not large when compared to the tiling of the skirt. In the second part of the image above, the texture
                    again seemed stretched, but this was because the blend mode used was "Legacy Mode". When using "Improved Mode" as shown in the third part of the image, the result is identical to that of the original texture. This is
                    because the texture was also repeated in the atlas, but did not lose its quality, because it is not repeated numerous times.

                    Now let's see the shirt mesh UV map.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/58"></doc.image>

                    The UV map of the shirt is large and causes the mesh texture to be repeated several times, but it is not as big as the UV map of the skirt. Therefore, the texture of the mesh was tiled without loss of quality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In summary... If you need to combine your character but he has a HUGE tile, simply register the mesh that has such a large tile, to be ignored. For example, I could register my skirt mesh, to be ignored during merging,
                    to avoid visualproblems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you need to combine tiled meshes, but the tiling is not large (for example, the mesh of this shirt), simply use the "Improved Mode" and everything will be fine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you need to combine a character that doesn't use any tiled texture, simply use "Legacy Mode". Legacy Mode is enabled by default, but Improved Mode is recommended in all of your merges.

                    <doc.info>
                        Increasing the resolution of the original textures, which will be tiled during merge, can increase the quality of these textures within the atlas after merge.

                    <doc.topictitle>Problems Solution: After combining my mesh using Improved Mode, a part of my character has the texture in the wrong place. Why?</doc.topictitle>

                    This is not common. But there is a minuscule chance of this happening, depending on how your model had the UV mapped. See the example below to understand better.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/59">
                        In the example merge, the UV mapping of the character's eye was in the wrong place. The texture on the left is the original texture of the character's eye. The texture on the right is the final atlas generated after
                        merge. Note that the texture of the eye in the atlas, had to be partially repeated, because some mesh that also uses this texture, has a tiling.
                    </doc.image>

                    <b>Explaining what happened:</b> There is some sub-mesh of this character, which uses the same material (and consequently the same texture) as the eye. This sub-mesh has a texture tile, which caused the texture to be
                    partially repeated in the atlas, and like the texture of the eye, it is together with that circular and white texture, the texture of the eye ended up being moved too.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was because of the way this character was mapped, perhaps a somewhat incorrect form for merges. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict that this would happen through an algorithm, so the Skinned Mesh Combiner
                    was unable to apply a correction for this. Everything else in the character model was correctly mapped. The eye was only mapped incorrectly because it was in a texture that needed to be repeated, thus, shifting its
                    position and leaving the position to which it should be.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To correct this, first, we can simply use a program like Blender, to separate the vertices of our character's eye, as in the figure...

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/60"></doc.image>

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/61">
                        Don't worry, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will combine all of these meshes into one.
                    </doc.image>

                    Now that the vertices of the eye have been separated into a completely new mesh, we just need to create a new material within Unity, and associate the texture of the eye with this material. Then add the new material, the
                    mesh that was separated. As shown above.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now that we have done this, there is no other mesh that will use this same material and texture, so the texture of the eye will not be repeated, moving the pixels of the eye. Therefore, the Skinned Mesh Combiner will not
                    repeat the texture of the eye and this mesh of the eye will have its own texture within the atlas.

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/62">
                        This is the result. The eye mesh has now been mapped correctly. All meshes were combined, meshes using tiled texture, had their tiles generated in the atlas, without problems (with Improved Mode) and the eye mesh has
                        its own texture and material, which ended the mapping problem.
                    </doc.image>

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/63">
                        This is the atlas generated after merging the character with the fixed problem. The texture marked with a red line, is the duplicated and exclusive texture for the mesh of the eye to which we separate. It was not
                        tiled, as the mesh we separated for the eye, does not use tiled textures, so the Skinned Mesh Combiner did not attempt to repeat such texture.
                    </doc.image>

                    This process is only useful when you combine meshes using Improved Mode to combine tiled textures and the All In One blending method. This is not a frequent occurrence, but it is always good for you to be aware and
                    understand why it happens! In this case, to summarize again, this only happened because they had two parts of the model, which were using the same texture. A part of the model was using the white circular content of the
                    texture, and that part of the model was tiling the texture, which caused the pixels of the eyes in the texture to be moved from their original location. By separating the vertices of the character's eye and creating a
                    new texture just for this separate mesh, we solved the problem.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That is all!

                    Although this is rare, texture distortions, after merging, can occur for several reasons. One is the architecture (that is, the way) in which the model or its UV was created, which can make it difficult to merge and
                    insert textures in an atlas. Unity or Skinned Mesh Combiner configurations, etc.

                    If after combining your character's meshes, this happened, and the <doc.detach>Optimize Game Objects</doc.detach> option is active in your character's "Rig" import settings....

                    <doc.image src="DocumentationFiles/images/67"></doc.image>

                    Disabling the "Optimize Game Objects" option should correct this problem. The "Optimize Game Objects" option will remove the Bone hierarchy (GameObjects and Transforms) from your character, this affects the way the
                    Skinned Mesh Combiner reads these meshes and bone information, etc. Without the bone hierarchy, the Skinned Mesh Combiner cannot read the information and that happens. After disabling the "Optimize GameObjects" option,
                    the problem is solved.

                    You just combined your character's meshes, at run time, using the Skinned Mesh Combiner's C# API, and then the meshes that were combined simply disappeared.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This happens for a reason. Unity has a system where you can inform Unity, which meshes or textures can be read by C# at run time. With that, Unity can further optimize mesh and texture files. It turns out that if any of
                    your meshes or textures are not marked "R/W Enabled" Unity cannot read them at run time which means that the Skinned Mesh Combiner also doesn't have access to them and so the character disappears after merging.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To correct this problem, simply activate the "Read/Write Enabled" option in all of its textures and meshes that will be combined at run time and the problem will be solved!

                    In some situations, you may be an Anima2D user and already have all your characters already packaged in a single Atlas, but you do not have the meshes of each character combined. So, when you try to match the meshes of
                    one of your characters, they seem to be positioned in the wrong places.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is because the "Only Anima2D Meshes" blending method is already optimized to generate an atlas from the Sprites of each mesh of your character.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In these situations, you can follow the following workflow...
